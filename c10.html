<p><b>Why work for the government?</b><br>
    You might have considered working for the government at the local, state or federal level. Here are five compelling reasons why working for the government might appeal to you:
</p>
<br>
<dt>1. Generous compensation </dt>
<dd>The U.S. Office of Personnel Management announced in January of 2021 that it was raising the minimum wage for U.S. federal civilian employees to $15 per hour. There are a total of 2.2 million federal employees and this change affected 67,000 of them.Many federal government positions with salaries are also part of the Federal Wage System, which mandates regular raises or "step increases" at least once every three years. Due to these statistics, the mandates in place and hourly wage increases, government jobs tend to pay more generously than non-government jobs</dd>
<br>
<dt>2. Better benefits with government jobs</dt>
<dd>Most government jobs come with health and dental insurance, and many offer low-cost life insurance. You may also find more retirement pensions in government jobs</dd>
<br>
<dt>3. Working to better the public</dt>
<dd>Employees in every sector of government work for the good of the people. Government jobs are created with the objective of making life better for the people that encompass the government. Choosing a career in any sector of government can be extremely rewarding when you know you are working to improve the community or nation.</dd>
<br>
<dt>4. Governments are always hiring</dt>
<dd>As long as a government exists, they will be hiring. If funding diminishes in one sector, another sector can be growing. Different from a private company, governments will exist in society forever, and you can find a job in one area of the government or another.</dd>
<br>
<dt>5. Job security</dt>
<dd>Government jobs provide a sense of security because of the eligibility for permanent appointment in many sectors and government industries. Many federal jobs offer permanent appointment after three years of consistent work. Many federal, state and local agencies also consist of ongoing programs that can last indefinitely.</dd>
