<p><b>What is an architect?</b><br>
is the art and discipline of creating a building, room or other environment that people use for an intended purpose. An architect plans, designs and directs the construction of those environments. There are many types of architects. Some have a broader scope, while others involve a narrower skill set. No matter what field you choose, you can ultimately apply a range of engineering, technological and design principles to complete your tasks.</dd> 

Many jobs in architecture require a minimum of a bachelor's degree from an accredited program. Depending on the state, architects may need to complete a licensing process to become registered architects through the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB).
